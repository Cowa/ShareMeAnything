ShareMeAnything
===============

*No chat, no talk, only share*

Based on my [prototype](https://github.com/Cowa/SMA-Prototype).

Concept

Progress
--------

Currently, basic functionalities are implemented (camera, image, draw, YouTube & Vimeo).
The side server is fully functional at this time (it will need improvements later).

The remaining work, before the first release, is the front-end (responsive, cross-devices).
To test everything quickly, I made a kind of *back-front-end*. It's ugly BUT functional.

If you run **ShareMeAnything** now, this *back-front* will be used (even ugly, it's fun, yeah!).

Run it
------

Obviously, you need **NodeJS**.

```npm install && node app.js```

You can enjoy it at your **localhost:8080**
