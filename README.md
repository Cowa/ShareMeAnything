ShareMeAnything
===============

*No chat, no talk, only share*

Based on my [prototype](https://github.com/Cowa/SMA-Prototype).

Concept

Progress
--------

Currently, basic functionalities are implemented (camera, image, draw, YouTube & Vimeo).
The side server is fully functional at this time (it will need improvements later).

The remaining work, before the first release, is the front-end (responsive, cross-devices).
To test everything quickly, I made a kind of *back-front-end*. It's ugly BUT functional.

If you want to have a look on **ShareMeAnything**, use this *back-front* by setting ```backMode``` to ```true``` (in app.js).
